Algorithm:
Recursive algorithm is used.
If head->next == NULL, we've reached the unit's place. So we add 1 here, and we return the node.
For every other node, we check if the next node has a value = 10. If it does, then we make its value = 0, and carry the extra 1 to the present node. This keeps happening
recursively

Code:
Node* addOne(Node *head) 
    {
        if(head->next == NULL)
        {
            head->data ++;
            return head;
        }
        else
        {
            Node* temp = addOne(head->next);
            if(temp->data == 10)
            {
                temp->data = 0;
                head->data += 1;
            }
            head->next = temp;
            return head;
        }
    }
